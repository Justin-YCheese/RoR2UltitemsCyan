	Ask my Friends Questions:
- Rename Viral Smog to Viral Cure? Viral Eessence? Viral Lilac?

	When Playing:
- Add jump buffer timer to Frisbee (because it's being janky, Test with Hunter's Harpoon)

	When Testing:
- temp Corroding Vault priority


- Rotten Bones works when time is frozen...
	- Because using Run.instance.time
- Check that Mythrixs can apply starve
- Test Obsolute in void fields and Newt shop Xenon Ampoule
- Test Tiny Igloo with Turrets
- Test All Items

	My Item Add Order:
- Resin Whirlpool
- Worm Holes
- Power Chips
- Trebuchet
- Jelly Jail

	When updating mod check:
- Bugs / Tests
- Version number (Ultitems Main / Manifest)
- Readme in Thunderstore folder
	- Then copy to workspace
- Update DLL and Bundle
- Update Manifest dependencies
	- Check current item count
- zip
	- by compressing content of thunderstore folder not the folder itself
- Has the tags: Mods | Items | Survivors of the Void | Seekers of the Storm Update | Alloyed Collective
- Push git changes

	DLC Notes:
- An item transforamtion can fail if there are not enough items for min transformation, or if the inventory is diabled


	Removed for now...
- Deluged Pail
	- They changed something about inventory count so I'll investigate later
- FIXED | Removed TAKEDAMAGEPROCESS IL code insertion
    - Grapevine
    - Silver Thread
    - Koala Sticker
- FIXED | Bithday Candle & Rotten Bones 
	- Doesn't give buff on pickup for some reason...
	- But it does on stage start
- FIXED | HMT & Zorse Pill
	- HMT Doesn't apply any fire despite 100% chance with DoT status effects...
	- And I don't think the void version can easily compile without base item
- Pig's Spork
	- I don't know...
- Oboslute
	- It is just overall funky and I don't know if it fully works
	- Uses transforms and I don't know if Shrine of Order was changed too with temp items


	Fixing for DLC:

- Use Too Many Items Delegate System for Taking Damage functions
	- Will be alot better for when the damage funciton updates, and better compatibility with other mods
	- Test if it works in multiplayer first

- What is the item tag AllowedForUseAsCraftingIngredient?
	- There's a crafting mechanic now that I'll add items to
- What is the item tag ExtractorUnitBlacklist?
	- This doesn't prevent items from being taken, but prevents them from being channeled


- Use WithPickupIndex instead of .itemindex property for unique pickups
	- public readonly UniquePickup WithPickupIndex(PickupIndex pickupIndex)

- What is inventory.inventoryDisabled? and this.allowWhenDisabled?
	- Some attacks disable the inventory and the allowWhenDisabled bypasses this



- Find each GetItemCount() use and change to either 
- RemoveItem obsolete, use RemoveItemPermanent or RemoveItemTemp or RemoveItemChanneled
- Try using item transform function
	- It is used for when items break. Items Checked:
		Silver Thread
	- When items are scrapped?

// TODO doublecheck this orders temporary items as well
// TODO add temporary item blacklist to all lunars
// TODO check if channeled items can be removed
// TODO Change to use Reference
// TODO check if temporary items will mess with this count for scissors

The Temporary List
- Check temporary Birthday Candles
	- Should be fine but who knows?
- Temporary Vault and Scissors
	- How do they work between stages? should the things they grant be temp?
	- For vault ues for Scissors no
- Temporary Scissors turns into temporary scraps when consumed?
	- Pointlss as nothing takes temporary scraps?


	For Future Consideration:

- Toy Robot does pull in junk even for non drifter players
- Zores Pill doesn't work on weak spots?
	- Zorse Pill Does not include Head shot damage from railgunner
- Scorpian doesn't apply fire for HMT?
- Could make birthday candle remove longest candle when an item is lost
- Check how Kenetic Shield detects dropped shield
- See if Lowhealth tag can be added to Pot of Regolith
- For now Rocky Taffy doesn't freeze barrier when there's no shield
	- so I increased barrier...
- For now a tmep Corroding Vault gives 15 real items (mostly because that race of 80 seconds to beat the level is real?)
	- Does the time only start when you pick up the item? or will it despawn
	- Same for InhabitedCoffin
- For now a temp scissors will function with scrap. But it will always return permanant scrap, and will always try removeing only permanant scissors.

- Zorse Doesn't work with surikens (the surikens don't apply Zorse)

- Zorse not Network Effect? (or even work?)
    - Does affect appear in multiplayer?
- Permenant fire bug?
- If jumping with Crysotope the frame of landing? then infinite buff? with frisbee too?
- Crysotope and Frisbee are disabled when gaining certain buffs (i.e. hunter's harpoon)
- If hit with flea bag greater than 200% double flea bag drop chance (now that crit is only x2)

- Make Pot of Regolith give lots of armor for a second after use
	- Or some other thing so it's like a parry in a way
- Blast showers on bandit has visual glitch? Doesn't appear and put on special (perhaps because I switched equipment after using)
- Make Tiny Igloo also increase size of
	- gilded money zone
		- (Works mechanicaly but dosen't change visually)
	- Healing wards
	- Count total igloos within specific zone? (so seperating stacks is okay?)

- Make Macroseismograph launch all characters the same way
	- Use Jellyfish explosion instead (and increase range) (or use both?)
- Transcendence, Taffy, Sue’s Mandibles
	- Doesn't work? Why?
- Test Threads
	- Offer to Rebirth check consumed items
- See how many Jealous Foes does it takes to activate each on kill frenzy effect
	- Berserker's Pauldron, Resonant Disc, Chronic Expansion
- Add sound for losing Birthday Buff
- Change Rocky Taffy to only give buff at Full Heath?


- fix Rocky Taffy with Transcendence

- Use heal fraction for percent heals
- Change Koala to do nothing if player doesn't have one shot protection enabled? ()

- remove public static ExpansionDef sotvDLC;
- Optimize SonorousPail by using indexing arrays
- Add DLC required to void items (Void items can still be obtained with dlc disabled?)
- Yield Sign can reduce your speed when using speed mode (because displacement greater than max speed)
- change Yield Attack from will o' wisp to blast attack


- What happens with pickups if you die after gravitating pickup?
- Universal Solute
	- When disolving all available red items, doesn't replace with solvent (because of Microbots?)
	- Add transform notification when picking up a dissolved item?
- Add VFX:
	- Add visual affect for treads triggering (extra items and snap)
	- Add visual and audio effect for picking up and using grapes
	- Ultraviolet Bulb
		- When triggered
	- Ice Cubes
		- When activated
	- Pot of Regolith
		- When activated
	- Koala Sticker (Damage Color, VFX)
		- When blocked
	- Sues Mandibles (Warning Effect)
		- When running out
	- RAM
		- When gaining 4 stacks and at max stacks
	- CremeBrulee
		- When healing
	- RottenBones
		- When increasing
	- Jealous Foe
		- Drowsy (Collecting effect)
		- Awake (A wave upon each activation)
		- Sleeping (???)
	- Pigspork
		- While you have the buff
	- Rocky Taffy
		- Granting barrier should have an effect and sound
		- Recharging buff
	- Dried Ham
		- Hitting enemy
	- Add Toy Robot radius, and other radius effects
	- Birthday Candles
		- Losing stacks
- Zorse Pill has wrong sprit in read me
- Change Fleabag and Grape orb color


- Sonorous Server Client differences?
	- Visual Glitch with Blizzard (I picked up sonorous pail while haveing blizzard up)
	- Getting Bands may not work?
- Add Support for Simulacrum
- Silver Thread still activating cauldron fireworks if have normal amount of items but not new cost
- Add actual proc chain accountability for items?
- Downloaded RAM and Jealous Foe will not synergize with buff duration increase as they don't use addTimedBuff


	Options for Code:
- Pigs spork and Trancedence (does it trigger low health?)
	- Might need: "this.IsHealthBelowThreshold(this.health - num14, 0.25f)"
