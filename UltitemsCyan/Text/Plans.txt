	Ask my Friends Questions:


	When Playing:
- Add jump buffer timer to Frisbee (because it's being janky, Test with Hunter's Harpoon)

	When Testing:
- Check that Mythrixs can apply starve
- Test All Items

	My Item Add Order:

- Worm Holes
- Power Chips
- Trebuchet
- Jelly Jail
- Resin Whirlpool

	When updating mod check:
- Bugs / Tests
- Version number (Ultitems Main / Manifest)
- Readme in Thunderstore folder
	- Then copy to workspace
- Update DLL and Bundle
- Update Manifest dependencies
	- Check current item count
- zip
	- by compressing content of thunderstore folder not the folder itself
- Has the tags: Mods | Items | Survivors of the Void | Seekers of the Storm Update | Alloyed Collective
- Push git changes

	DLC Notes:
- An item transforamtion can fail if there are not enough items for min transformation, or if the inventory is diabled

	For Future Consideration:



- Obsolute. If an item is in a tri terminal and erased, it should be replaced with grey solvent
	- Lunar shop ignores most recently erased item
- Toy Robot pulls in junk even if your not a drifter
	- But JunkPickup hasn't been added as a class to RoR2 files
	- Toy Robot does pull in junk even for non drifter players
- Zores Pill doesn't work on weak spots?
	- Zorse Pill Does not include Head shot damage from railgunner
- Scorpian doesn't apply fire for HMT?
- Could make birthday candle remove longest candle when an item is lost

- For now a temp scissors will function with scrap. But it will always return permanant scrap, and will always try removeing only permanant scissors.

- Zorse Doesn't work with surikens (the surikens don't apply Zorse)

- Zorse not Network Effect? (or even work?)
    - Does affect appear in multiplayer?

- If jumping with Crysotope the frame of landing? then infinite buff? with frisbee too?
	- Crysotope and Frisbee are disabled when gaining certain buffs (i.e. hunter's harpoon)
- If hit with flea bag greater than 200% double flea bag drop chance (now that crit is only x2)

- Blast showers on bandit has visual glitch? Doesn't appear and put on special (perhaps because I switched equipment after using)
- Make Tiny Igloo also increase size of
	- gilded money zone
		- (Works mechanicaly but dosen't change visually)
	- Healing wards

- Make Macroseismograph launch all characters the same way
	- Use Jellyfish explosion instead (and increase range) (or use both?)
- Transcendence, Taffy, Sue’s Mandibles
	- Doesn't work? Why?
- Test Threads
	- Offer to Rebirth check consumed items
- See how many Jealous Foes does it takes to activate each on kill frenzy effect
	- Berserker's Pauldron, Resonant Disc, Chronic Expansion
- Add sound for losing Birthday Buff

- fix Rocky Taffy with Transcendence

- Use heal fraction for percent heals
- Change Koala to do nothing if player doesn't have one shot protection enabled?

- remove public static ExpansionDef sotvDLC;
- Optimize SonorousPail by using indexing arrays
- Add DLC required to void items (Void items can still be obtained with dlc disabled?)

- What happens with pickups if you die after gravitating pickup?
- Universal Solute
	- When disolving all available red items, doesn't replace with solvent (because of Microbots?)
	- Add transform notification when picking up a dissolved item?
- Add VFX:
	- Add visual affect for treads triggering (extra items and snap)
	- Add visual and audio effect for picking up and using grapes
	- Ultraviolet Bulb
		- When triggered
	- Ice Cubes
		- When activated
	- Pot of Regolith
		- When activated
	- Koala Sticker (Damage Color, VFX)
		- When blocked
	- Sues Mandibles (Warning Effect)
		- When running out
	- RAM
		- When gaining 4 stacks and at max stacks
	- CremeBrulee
		- When healing
	- RottenBones
		- When increasing
	- Jealous Foe
		- Drowsy (Collecting effect)
		- Awake (A wave upon each activation)
		- Sleeping (???)
	- Pigspork
		- While you have the buff
	- Rocky Taffy
		- Granting barrier should have an effect and sound
		- Recharging buff
	- Dried Ham
		- Hitting enemy
	- Add Toy Robot radius, and other radius effects
	- Birthday Candles
		- Losing stacks
- Change Fleabag and Grape orb color


- Sonorous Server Client differences?
	- Visual Glitch with Blizzard (I picked up sonorous pail while haveing blizzard up)
	- Getting Bands may not work?
- Add Support for Simulacrum
- Silver Thread still activating cauldron fireworks if have normal amount of items but not new cost
- Add actual proc chain accountability for items?
- Downloaded RAM and Jealous Foe will not synergize with buff duration increase as they don't use addTimedBuff


	Options for Code:
- Pigs spork and Trancedence (does it trigger low health?)
	- Might need: "this.IsHealthBelowThreshold(this.health - num14, 0.25f)"
